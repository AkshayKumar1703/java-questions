# Data structures

### If you want to store data in
1. One on the other - Stacks
2. Linear fashion - Array/ Linked List
3. Hierarchical Fashion - Trees
4. Connect Nodes - Graph

## Types of Data Structures in Java

### List of some of the common types of data structures in Java:

1. Array
2. Linked List
3. Stack 
4. Queue
5. Binary Tree
6. Binary Search Tree
7. Heap
8. Hashing 
9. Graph

### classification of types of Data Structures

There are two types of Data Structures:-
1. Primitive Data Structures
2. Non-primitive Data Structures

* Primitive data Structures are also called Primitive Data Types. byte, short,  int, float, char, boolean, long, and double are primitive Data types.

* Non-primitive data Structures - Non-primitive Data Structures are of two types:-

1. Linear Data Structures.
2. Non-linear Data Structures.

### Linear Data Structures - 
* The elements arranged in a linear fashion are called Linear Data Structures. Here, each element is connected to one other element only. Linear Data Structures are as follows:

* Arrays 
* Single dimensional Array
* Multidimensional Array
* Stack
* Queue
* Linked List 
* Singly-linked list
* Doubly Linked list
* Circular Linked List

### Non-Linear Data Structures - 
* The elements arranged in a non-linear fashion are called Non-Linear Data Structures. Here, each element is connected to n-other elements. Non-Linear Data Structures are as follows:

* Trees
* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* AVL Tree
* Red-Black Tree
* Heap
* MaxHeap
* MinHeap
* Hash
* HashSet
* HashMap
### Advantages of Data Structures in java
* Efficiency
* Reusability
* Processing Speed
* Abstraction
* Data Searching

### Classification of Data Structures
Data Structures can be classified as:-

* Static Data Structures are the Data structures whose size is declared and fixed at Compile Time and cannot be changed later are called Static Data structures.

### Example - Arrays
Dynamic Data Structures are the Data Structures whose size is not fixed at compile time and can be decided at runtime depending upon requirements are called Dynamic Data structures.
Example - Binary search tree using Java
Syntax:
1
2
3
Array declaration
datatype varname []=new datatype[size];  
datatype[] varname=new datatype[size];
